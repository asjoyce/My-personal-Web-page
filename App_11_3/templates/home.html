        <p>My Experience with the Filter Fiesta Contest:

            Participating in the Filter Fiesta contest at my college has been an exciting and rewarding experience. The challenge was to create a unique and engaging snap filter using the Snap AR application, which allowed me to dive into the world of augmented reality.
            
            At first, I was eager but unsure about how to fully utilize the Snap AR platform, so I spent time learning about its features and experimenting with different design elements. The process of creating a filter, from brainstorming ideas to bringing them to life, was both challenging and fun. I explored various creative tools within the Snap AR application to make the filter interactive, visually appealing, and aligned with current trends.
            
            Throughout this experience, I gained hands-on skills in AR design, learned how to combine creativity with technology, and developed a deeper understanding of augmented reality's potential in the digital world. It was also a great opportunity to collaborate with fellow participants, exchange ideas, and push my creative boundaries.
            
            Overall, this contest has not only enhanced my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in working with new technologies. I look forward to taking on more challenges in the future and continuing to explore the potential of AR in various creative fields.</p>
